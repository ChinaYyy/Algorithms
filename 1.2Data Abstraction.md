## 1.2 Data Abstraction

A Data Type is a set of values and a set of operations on those values.

In this section, we focus on the process of **defining and using data types**,which is known as `data abstraction`.

#### Inherited methods

- All java data types inherit a **toString()** method that returns a String representation of data-type values.
- Java calls this method when any data-type value is to be concatenated with a String value with the **+** operator.
- The default implementation is not particularly useful(it gives a **string representation of the memory address** of the data-type value).
- So we often provide an implementation that overrides the default, and include toString() in the API whenever we do so.
- Other examples: `equals()`, `compareTo()`, `hashCode()`

#### Objects

An object is an entity that can take on a data-type value.

Objects are characterized by three essential properties: `state`,`identity`,and `behavior`.

​	The state of an object is a value from its data type.

​	The identity of an object distinguishes one object from another.It is useful to think of an object's identity as the place where its value is stored in memory.

​	The behavior of an object is the effect of data-type operations.

##### Reference

A reference is a mechanism for accessing an object.

It is useful to think of a reference as a memory address.

`primitive types` and `reference types`.

#### Creating Objects

Each time that a client uses **new()**,the system:

- Allocates memory space for the object.
- Invokes the constructor to initialize its value.
- Returns a `reference` to the object.

#### Designing APIs

One of most important and challenging steps in building modern software is `designing APIs`.

**some pitfalls**:

 - too hard to  implement
- too hard to use
- too narrow
- too wide
- too general
- too specfic
- too dependent on a particular representation

#### Wrapper Types

Built-in reference types known as wrapper types.

`Boolean,Byte,Character,Double,Float,Integer,Long,Short ` correspond to `boolean,byte,char,double,float,int,long short`.

Java automatically converts from primitive types to warpper types when warranted(必要的).

For example, when an int value is concatenated with a String, it is converted to an Integer that can invoke toString().

#### Equality 

If we test equality with (a==b) where a and b are reference variables of the same type, we are testing whether the have the same identity:whether the references are equal.

Java's convention is that equals() must be` equivalence relation`:

- Reflexive(自反性): x.equals(x) is true.
- Symmetric(对称性): x.equals(y) is true if and only if y.equals(x).
- Transitive(传递性): if x.equals(y) and y.equals(z) are true, then so is x.equals(z).
- Consitance(一致性): mutiple invocations of x.equals(y) consistently return the same value, provided neither object is modified.
- Not null(非空性): x.equals(null) returns false.

```
public class Date
{
  private final int month;
  private final int day;
  private final int year;
  .
  .
  public boolean equals(Object x)
  {
    if (this == x) return true;
    if (x == null) return false;
    if (this.getClass() != x.getClass()) return false;
    Date that = (Date) x;
    if (this.day != that.day) return false;
    if (this.month != that.month) return false;
    if (this.year != that.year) return false;
    return true;
  }
}
```

#### Immutability

A downside of immutability stems from the fact that, unfortunately, `final` guarantees immutability **only when instance variables are primitive types**, not reference types.

If an instance variable of a reference type has the final modifier, the value of that instance variable will never change -- **it will always refer to the same object** -- **but the value of the object itself can change**.

#### Exception and Errors

```
throw new RuntimeException("Error message here.");
```

#### Assertions

By default ,assertions are disabled.

You can enable them from the command line by using the `--enableassertions` flag(`-ea` for short).

```
assert index >= 0 : "Negative index in method X";
```
