## Fundamentals

#### Objective

study a broad variety of important and useful algorithms

#### Content

1. basic programming model

2. data abstraction

   define `abstract data types`(ADTs)

3. three fundamental ADTs: `bags,queues,stack`

4. algorithm performance

   scientific method:

   1. develop hypotheses about performance 性能假设
   2. create methmatical models
   3. run experiments to test them
   4. repeat the process as necessary

#### Algorithms

- A `finite,deterministic,and effective` problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.
- It is the method,rather than the computer program itself,that specifics the steps we take to solve the problem.
- Algorythms are the stuff of computer science: the are central objects of study in the field.
- The primary reason to learn about algorithms is that this discipline gives us the potential to reap huge savings, even to the point of enabling us to do tasks that otherwise impossible.
- Careful algorithm design is an extremely effective part of the process of solving a huge problem, whatever the applications area.
- `Analysis of algorithms`
- Develop a style of `algorithm thinking.`
